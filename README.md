## Being a 401 Student...

* Develop your development as a developer, holistically

### Go beyond getting it to work...

* Why is software development so hard?
    * known vs unknown problems
* We value:
    * Collaboration with team members and business
    * Maintainable code (quality and comprehension)
* Emphasis on Refactoring and Code Improvement
* Trade-off decisions over right/wrong

### Collaboration and Communication
* “Growth Mindset” Learning and Self Awareness
* Active communication about coding when collaborating
    * 401 students don't say "it doesn't work"
    * What information exists? 
    * What does work? 
    * When did it stop working? 
    * What could you try to generate more information? 
    * One of the best ways to practice is through collaborative work...
* Purpose of pairing/collaborative exercises is to practice communication skills
* (pairing accelerates learning)
* Mindset software development team, not academic course work
    * "mixed" skill level
        * takes a variety of skill
        * more senior? lift teammate up, learn more by teaching
        * less senior? voice questions, raise issues, by senior in other areas

### Standards
* Uphold [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/codefellows/code-of-conduct) - Be Kind
* Make sure everyone has equity in opportunity to:
    * Speak, Ideate, and Lead

#### Lab Expectations
* Evidence of Refactoring and Code Improvement
* No cut-n-paste of other's code - Kinesthetic Learning 
* Own your repo, know lab process
* Unless explicitly mentioned otherwise, labs can be done collaboratively

### In Class
* Call out jargon, but learn to use...
* Ask to repeat, clarify, cover again...
* Be timely
	* Class
	* Labs
	* Readings

Questions?

## CS concepts
* Provide [models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong) for learning
* Turtles on turtles all the way down...
* Goal is contextual understanding
