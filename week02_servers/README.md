## Misc
* When doing collaborative lab submissions, each person still 
submits to canvas individually

## Missing Context
* Terms
    * module - small piece of functionality in a single module (file)
    * library - overall package of functionality (npm)
        * meant to be used by other code
        * toolbox of functionality via API
    * framework - overall package of functionality (npm)
        * meant to be a "way" to achieve a certain goal
        * API is way to build things
* What is an "object store" anyway?
* mocha: `before`, `after`, `beforeEach`, `afterEach`

## Learning Objectives
* Read, write, and manipulate encoded binary data using the Buffer class

## Agenda

* Binary Data
	* What is meaning?
	* Bits, Bytes, Words, DWords
	* BE LE "Endianness" byte order
	* signed/unsigned
	* "encoding"
	* "serialization"/"deserialization"
	* Meet `Buffer`
		* Data managed outside of JavaScript
		* Binary representation
		* Stored in Heap memory
		* Buffers access this memory
		* I/O methods
		* Beware of the number constructor
        * Binary Data
